# VibeStack System Architecture Plan

## Problem Definition
Design a scalable and secure system architecture for VibeStack, incorporating AI-driven behavioral analysis, personalized avatars, social gamification, and advanced monetization.

## Goals
- Define core components and their responsibilities.
- Establish clear service boundaries and interfaces.
- Ensure compliance with security and privacy standards.
- Plan for scalability and performance optimization.

## Constraints
- Must support 10M+ concurrent users with <500ms response times.
- Must comply with GDPR, CCPA, and healthcare data regulations.
- Use specified technology stack (React Native, Node.js/Python, etc.).

## Assumptions
- The platform will integrate with multiple social media and wearable APIs.
- Real-time data processing is critical for behavioral analysis.
- The architecture will be cloud-based with auto-scaling capabilities.

## Solution Overview
The architecture will be based on a microservices model, with each service having a well-defined responsibility. Key components include AI Behavioral Analysis, Avatar Companion System, Social Gamification Engine, and more. Security and privacy will be integral, with a zero-trust model and end-to-end encryption.

## Milestones
1. High-Level System Architecture Design
2. Service Boundary Definitions and Responsibilities
3. Data Models and API Specifications
4. Security Architecture Framework
5. Scalability and Performance Planning

## Risk Analysis
- Potential integration challenges with external APIs.
- Ensuring compliance with evolving security standards.
- Managing data privacy and consent across multiple jurisdictions.

## Success Criteria
- Architecture supports all specified functional and non-functional requirements.
- System is scalable and performs well under load.
- Security measures meet or exceed healthcare-grade standards.
- Clear documentation and diagrams are available for all components.
