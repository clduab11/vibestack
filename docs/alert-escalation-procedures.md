# Alert Escalation Procedures

This document outlines the escalation procedures for alerts generated by the production monitoring systems.

## Alert Severities

Alerts are categorized into the following severities:

- **Critical:** Indicates a P1-level incident. Requires immediate attention.
  - Examples: Service downtime, security breaches, data corruption.
- **Warning:** Indicates a P2-level incident or a potential P1. Requires prompt investigation.
  - Examples: Performance degradation, high resource utilization, failed deployments.
- **Info:** Informational events, typically do not require immediate action but should be reviewed.
  - Examples: Successful deployments, auto-scaling events, planned maintenance windows.

## Escalation Paths

### Critical Alerts (P1)

1.  **Immediate Notification:**
    *   On-call Level 1 (L1) engineer paged via PagerDuty (or similar).
    *   Automated notification to dedicated Slack/Teams channel (e.g., #ops-critical-alerts).
2.  **Acknowledgement:**
    *   L1 engineer acknowledges the alert within 5 minutes.
3.  **Initial Triage & Investigation:**
    *   L1 engineer investigates the issue, referencing relevant incident response playbooks.
    *   Duration: Aim for 15-30 minutes for initial assessment.
4.  **Escalation to L2 (if not resolved or requires deeper expertise):**
    *   If L1 cannot resolve or if the issue is complex, escalate to On-call Level 2 (L2) engineer.
    *   L1 provides a summary of findings to L2.
5.  **Escalation to Engineering Lead/Manager (if not resolved by L2):**
    *   If L2 cannot resolve within 30-60 minutes, or if business impact is severe, escalate to the relevant Engineering Lead or Manager.
6.  **Incident Commander:**
    *   For prolonged or widespread critical issues, an Incident Commander will be designated to coordinate efforts.
7.  **Communication:**
    *   Regular updates posted to the incident channel.
    *   Stakeholder communication managed by the Incident Commander or designated communications lead.

### Warning Alerts (P2)

1.  **Notification:**
    *   Notification to dedicated Slack/Teams channel (e.g., #ops-warning-alerts).
    *   Email notification to the responsible team/distribution list.
    *   May page L1 engineer if occurring outside business hours or if multiple correlated warnings arise.
2.  **Acknowledgement:**
    *   Acknowledged by a team member within 30 minutes during business hours, or by L1 on-call if paged.
3.  **Investigation:**
    *   Investigated by the responsible team during business hours.
    *   If a warning alert indicates a rapidly degrading situation that could become critical, it should be treated with higher urgency.
4.  **Escalation:**
    *   If the issue cannot be resolved by the primary team or if it persists, escalate to L2 or subject matter experts as needed.

### Info Alerts

1.  **Notification:**
    *   Logged to a dedicated Slack/Teams channel (e.g., #ops-info-alerts) or dashboard.
    *   No direct paging.
2.  **Review:**
    *   Reviewed periodically by the operations team (e.g., daily or weekly) to identify trends or potential issues.
    *   No immediate action required unless patterns indicate an underlying problem.

## On-Call Responsibilities

*   Acknowledge alerts promptly.
*   Follow documented incident response playbooks.
*   Escalate in a timely manner if unable to resolve.
*   Document actions taken and findings.
*   Participate in post-incident reviews.

## Review and Updates

These escalation procedures will be reviewed quarterly and updated as necessary to reflect changes in the system, team structure, or tooling.
