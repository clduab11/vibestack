# Incident Response Playbooks

This document provides a collection of playbooks for responding to common incidents identified by the monitoring system. These are living documents and should be updated as systems and procedures evolve.

## General Incident Response Steps

1.  **Detect & Alert:** Monitoring system triggers an alert.
2.  **Acknowledge & Assess:** On-call engineer acknowledges the alert and performs an initial assessment of the impact and scope.
3.  **Identify & Isolate:** Identify the affected component(s) and, if possible, isolate them to prevent further impact.
4.  **Communicate:**
    *   Internal: Notify relevant teams via designated channels (e.g., Slack #incident-response).
    *   External (if user-impacting): Prepare and deliver stakeholder communications as per the communication plan.
5.  **Diagnose & Hypothesize:** Investigate the root cause. Formulate hypotheses.
6.  **Remediate & Recover:** Apply fixes or workarounds. Verify recovery.
7.  **Verify & Monitor:** Confirm that the issue is resolved and systems are stable. Continue monitoring.
8.  **Post-Incident Review (PIR):** Conduct a blameless PIR to understand the root cause, what went well, what could be improved, and identify follow-up actions.

## Playbook: Service Downtime / Unavailability

**Triggering Alerts:** `InstanceDown`, `HighErrorRate` (if leading to unavailability), `KubeNodeNotReady` (if impacting service)

**Severity:** Critical

**Goal:** Restore service functionality as quickly as possible.

**Steps:**

1.  **Verify Downtime:**
    *   Check health check endpoints directly.
    *   Review monitoring dashboards (Operations Dashboard) for related metrics (CPU, memory, network, error rates).
    *   Check logs from affected services ([`monitoring/fluentd-daemonset.yaml`](monitoring/fluentd-daemonset.yaml) for log aggregation setup).
2.  **Identify Scope:**
    *   Is it a single instance, multiple instances, or the entire service?
    *   Are dependent services affected?
3.  **Attempt Restart/Rollback (if applicable and safe):**
    *   For stateless services, attempt a rolling restart of affected pods/instances.
    *   If a recent deployment is suspected, consider initiating a rollback using predefined scripts (e.g., [`scripts/rollback_k8s.sh`](scripts/rollback_k8s.sh), [`scripts/rollback_config_k8s.sh`](scripts/rollback_config_k8s.sh)). Refer to [`docs/emergency_rollback_procedures.md`](docs/emergency_rollback_procedures.md).
4.  **Check Infrastructure:**
    *   Kubernetes: Check `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`, `kubectl logs <pod-name>`, `kubectl get events`.
    *   Node status: `KubeNodeNotReady` alert details.
    *   Network: Check [`kubernetes/network-policy.yaml`](kubernetes/network-policy.yaml) if network related.
    *   Resource limits: Check CPU/Memory usage on Operations Dashboard.
5.  **Check Dependencies:**
    *   Databases, external APIs, message queues. Are they healthy?
6.  **Escalate:** Follow critical alert escalation procedures ([`docs/alert-escalation-procedures.md`](docs/alert-escalation-procedures.md)).
7.  **Communicate:** Provide updates on status and ETA for resolution.
8.  **Post-Mortem:** Conduct a thorough post-mortem.

## Playbook: Performance Degradation

**Triggering Alerts:** `HighRequestLatency`, `HighCpuUsage`, `HighMemoryUsage`

**Severity:** Warning (can escalate to Critical if severe)

**Goal:** Identify the cause of degradation and restore performance to acceptable levels.

**Steps:**

1.  **Verify Degradation:**
    *   Confirm against performance baselines and SLOs.
    *   Check Operations Dashboard for latency, CPU, memory metrics.
2.  **Identify Scope:**
    *   Specific endpoints, services, or overall system?
    *   Time of onset? Correlate with deployments or other events.
3.  **Investigate Bottlenecks:**
    *   **Application Code:** Profiling, APM traces.
    *   **Database:** Slow queries, connection pool exhaustion.
    *   **Infrastructure:** CPU/Memory saturation, disk I/O, network latency.
    *   **External Dependencies:** Latency from third-party services.
4.  **Scale Resources (if applicable):**
    *   If resource exhaustion is identified, consider scaling pods/nodes if auto-scaling hasn't kicked in or is insufficient.
5.  **Optimize/Rollback:**
    *   If a recent code change is suspected, consider rollback.
    *   Identify and optimize slow queries or inefficient code paths.
6.  **Escalate:** Follow warning/critical alert escalation procedures.
7.  **Communicate:** Inform relevant teams about the degradation and remediation steps.

## Playbook: Security Incident (e.g., High Authentication Failures)

**Triggering Alerts:** `HighAuthenticationFailureRate`, other custom security alerts.

**Severity:** Critical

**Goal:** Contain the threat, mitigate impact, and understand the attack vector.

**Steps:**

1.  **Verify Incident:**
    *   Check Security Dashboard for corroborating evidence.
    *   Review authentication logs, WAF logs, IDS/IPS alerts.
2.  **Identify Scope & Impact:**
    *   Source IPs, targeted accounts, affected systems.
    *   Is data exfiltration suspected?
3.  **Containment:**
    *   Block malicious IPs at firewall/WAF.
    *   Temporarily lock affected accounts if necessary.
    *   Isolate affected systems if a breach is confirmed.
4.  **Preserve Evidence:**
    *   Take snapshots, collect logs, document actions.
5.  **Eradication:**
    *   Identify and remove the root cause (e.g., patch vulnerability, remove malware).
6.  **Recovery:**
    *   Restore systems from backups if necessary.
    *   Reset compromised credentials.
7.  **Escalate:**
    *   Immediately escalate to the security team and management as per [`docs/alert-escalation-procedures.md`](docs/alert-escalation-procedures.md).
    *   Legal/Compliance teams may need to be involved depending on the nature of the incident.
8.  **Communicate:** Follow established internal and external communication protocols for security incidents.
9.  **Post-Mortem & Lessons Learned:** Critical for improving security posture.

## Playbook: Deployment Failure

**Triggering Alerts:** `DeploymentFailed`

**Severity:** Warning

**Goal:** Understand the cause of failure and either successfully redeploy or rollback.

**Steps:**

1.  **Review Deployment Logs:**
    *   Check CI/CD pipeline output (e.g., from [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)).
    *   Check Kubernetes deployment status and pod logs.
2.  **Identify Error:**
    *   Configuration error (e.g., bad environment variable in [`kubernetes/deployment.yaml`](kubernetes/deployment.yaml))?
    *   Image pull error?
    *   Application startup failure (check pod logs)?
    *   Failed health/readiness probes?
3.  **Attempt Rollback:**
    *   Initiate automated rollback procedures: [`scripts/rollback_k8s.sh`](scripts/rollback_k8s.sh).
    *   Verify successful rollback.
4.  **Diagnose Root Cause of Failure:**
    *   Analyze logs and error messages.
    *   If config related, check changes to [`kubernetes/deployment.yaml`](kubernetes/deployment.yaml) or related ConfigMaps/Secrets.
5.  **Fix and Retest:**
    *   Address the root cause in a development/staging environment.
    *   Test thoroughly before attempting production redeployment.
6.  **Communicate:** Inform stakeholders about the failed deployment and rollback.
