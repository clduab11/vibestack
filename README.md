## üéØ Market Opportunity

The global habit tracking app market is projected to reach $3.8 billion by 2028, but current solutions fail to address the core problem: **habit formation is boring and solitary**. VibeStack disrupts this market by making habit formation:

- **Social**: Share wins, compete with friends, inspire others
- **Intelligent**: AI that learns and adapts to your unique patterns
- **Engaging**: Gamification that makes progress addictive
- **Personal**: Avatar companions with distinct personalities
- **Viral**: Turn achievements into shareable content
