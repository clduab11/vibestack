## What if your habits could go viral?

Imagine if building good habits was as addictive as scrolling TikTok. What if your morning routine could inspire thousands? What if your AI companion knew you better than you know yourself?

**VibeStack isn't just another habit tracker.** It's the first social platform where your personal growth becomes shareable content, where AI doesn't just remind you‚Äîit *gets* you, and where every small win can spark a movement.

---

## üéØ The Problem We're Solving

- **Habit apps are boring** ‚Üí We make them social and shareable
- **AI feels robotic** ‚Üí Our avatars have personality and evolve with you  
- **Progress feels invisible** ‚Üí Every win becomes content worth sharing
- **Motivation fades** ‚Üí Friends and challenges keep you accountable
- **One-size-fits-all** ‚Üí AI analyzes your actual behavior patterns

---

## ‚ú® What Makes VibeStack Different

### üß† **Your AI Knows You** (Like, Really Knows You)
Your avatar companion doesn't just send generic reminders. It learns from your phone usage, sleep patterns, and daily rhythms to suggest habits that actually stick. Think of it as a personal coach who never judges, always encourages, and gets smarter every day.

### üì± **Habits That Go Viral**
Every milestone becomes shareable content. Hit a 30-day streak? Your avatar creates a celebration post. Nail a difficult habit? Auto-generate content for TikTok, Instagram, or Twitter. Your growth journey becomes inspiration for others.

### üéÆ **Social Accountability That Actually Works**
Challenge friends to habit duels. See who can maintain their morning routine longer. Get real-time encouragement from your network. Because everything's easier when you're not doing it alone.

### üé® **Avatars With Personality**
Choose your AI companion's vibe: the encouraging best friend, the no-nonsense coach, or the zen master. Your avatar evolves as you do, celebrating wins and helping you bounce back from setbacks.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

VibeStack is built as a modular, microservices-based platform with 8 core architectural modules:

### üìä **Core Modules Overview**

| Module | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| üß† [AI Behavioral Analysis](pseudocode/01_ai_behavioral_analysis_engine.md) | ‚úÖ Specified | Phone data collection, habit pattern recognition, behavioral insights |
| ü§ñ [Avatar Companion System](pseudocode/02_avatar_companion_system.md) | ‚úÖ Specified | AI personality engine, adaptive conversation system, emotional intelligence |
| üéÆ [Social Gamification](pseudocode/03_social_gamification_engine.md) | ‚úÖ Specified | Challenge system, leaderboards, viral content generation |
| üí∞ [Monetization Architecture](pseudocode/04_advanced_monetization_architecture.md) | ‚úÖ Specified | Premium features, creator economy, brand partnerships |
| üîí [Security & Privacy](pseudocode/05_security_privacy_framework.md) | üî® **Implementing** | Healthcare-grade security, GDPR compliance, ethical AI |
| ‚öôÔ∏è [Core System Functions](pseudocode/06_core_system_functions.md) | üî® **Implementing** | User management, data synchronization, real-time processing |
| üß™ [Testing Framework](pseudocode/07_testing_framework.md) | ‚úÖ Implemented | TDD approach, integration testing, security validation |
| üåê [API Specification](pseudocode/08_api_specification.md) | üî® **Implementing** | REST/GraphQL APIs, external integrations, real-time WebSocket |

### üîß **Implemented Components**

Our current implementation includes:

```javascript
// API Gateway with modular route architecture
const { APIRouter } = require('./src/api/apiRoutes');
const { SecurityMiddleware } = require('./src/middleware/securityMiddleware');

// Implemented route handlers
- Authentication & Authorization (JWT, 2FA, RBAC)
- User Management (profiles, preferences, social connections)  
- Content Management (posts, challenges, achievements)
- System Health & Monitoring (metrics, health checks)
```

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Architecture (Implemented)**

Healthcare-grade security layer with:
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: TOTP, backup codes, biometric
- **Authorization Engine**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Input Validation**: Joi-based schema validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable per-endpoint limits
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection for state-changing operations
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, XSS protection

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Current Implementation Stack:**

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js with modular architecture
- **Security**: bcryptjs, JWT, speakeasy (2FA), comprehensive middleware stack
- **Testing**: Jest with TDD approach (162+ tests, full coverage)
- **Validation**: Joi schema validation with sanitization
- **Architecture**: Dependency injection, modular microservices pattern

**Code Examples:**

```javascript
// Security Middleware Factory (Implemented)
class SecurityMiddlewareFactory {
  constructor(deps) {
    this.authService = deps.authService;
    this.validationService = deps.validationService;
    this.rateLimitService = deps.rateLimitService;
  }
  
  // Composable security chain
  createSecurityChain(options = {}) {
    return [
      this.createAuthenticationMiddleware(),
      this.createAuthorizationMiddleware(options.requiredRoles),
      this.createInputValidationMiddleware(),
      this.createRateLimitingMiddleware(options.rateLimit)
    ];
  }
}

// API Route with Security (Implemented)
class AuthenticationRoutes {
  constructor({ authService, validationService, securityMiddleware }) {
    this.authService = authService;
    this.validationService = validationService;
    this.securityMiddleware = securityMiddleware;
  }
  
  register() {
    return async (req, res, next) => {
      const result = this.validationService.validateRegistration(req.body);
      if (!result.isValid) {
        return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Validation failed' });
      }
      const regResult = await this.authService.register(result.sanitizedData);
      res.status(201).json({ success: true, data: regResult });
    };
  }
}
```

**Planned Extensions:**
- **Frontend**: React Native (iOS + Android) 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with real-time sync
- **AI**: Multi-LLM integration (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes + Docker
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

## üåê API Architecture (Implemented)

**Core API Endpoints:**

```bash
# Authentication & Authorization
POST   /auth/register          # User registration with validation
POST   /auth/login             # JWT-based authentication  
POST   /auth/logout            # Secure session termination
POST   /auth/verify-token      # Token validation
POST   /auth/refresh-token     # Token refresh mechanism
POST   /auth/setup-2fa         # Two-factor authentication setup
POST   /auth/verify-2fa        # TOTP verification

# User Management
GET    /users/profile          # User profile retrieval
PUT    /users/profile          # Profile updates
GET    /users/preferences      # User preferences
PUT    /users/preferences      # Preference management
GET    /users/social           # Social connections
POST   /users/social/connect   # Connect with friends

# Content & Social
GET    /content/feed           # Personalized content feed
POST   /content/posts          # Create habit posts
GET    /content/challenges     # Active challenges
POST   /content/challenges     # Create new challenges

# System & Monitoring  
GET    /health                 # Health check with component status
GET    /version                # API version information
GET    /metrics                # System metrics (authenticated)
```

**Security Implementation:**
- All endpoints protected with JWT authentication
- Rate limiting per endpoint (configurable thresholds)
- Input validation using Joi schemas
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Comprehensive error handling with sanitized responses

**Ethical AI Framework (Designed):**
```pseudocode
// Algorithmic fairness testing (from security pseudocode)
FUNCTION assessAlgorithmBias(algorithm, testData):
    biasMetrics = {
        demographicParity: 0,
        equalOpportunity: 0, 
        disparateImpact: 0,
        individualFairness: 0
    }
    
    // Test across protected categories
    protectedCategories = ["age", "gender", "race", "socioeconomic"]
    
    FOR EACH category IN protectedCategories:
        categoryResults = testAlgorithmForCategory(algorithm, testData, category)
        // Calculate fairness metrics...
        
    // TEST: Algorithm must meet fairness thresholds  
    FOR EACH metric, value IN biasMetrics:
        ASSERT value >= 0.8  // 80% fairness threshold
```

## üéÆ How It Works (Technical Implementation)
